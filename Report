To conclude this project, we should answer the following 5 questions in a
separate document attached to your project:

i. Which insights did you gain from your EDA? Were any columns
highly correlated? If so, name them.
I did gain insight into realizing that the most selected type of music was sadness and violence. I did noticed that sadness was the highest typr for genres pop and country.

ii. How did you determine which columns to drop or keep? If your EDA informed this process, explain which insights you used to determine which columns were not needed.
I determined which columns to drop based off of the values it gave me like 'unnamed:0' had no values and 'lyrics' because it was asked of me in the project. Also, I droped non-numerical columns because I can only use numerical categories if I want to do a Kmeans analysis.

iii. What was the optimal number of clusters in your cluster model? Explain how you determined this value.
Optimal number was 3 based off the elbow plot I conducted, if you can seee the steepest drop that is how you can determine the number of clusters in the model.

iv. Take a look at the respective songs that fell into your clusters. Describe these clusters in human terms to the best of your ability using the columns in your dataset (for example high-gospel songs, low-gospel songs, etc). Feel free to listen to these songs as well to get a sense of what nuance your algorithm picked up on.
The nuance that my algorithm picked up on were pop high energy songs as well as sadness songs that rhymed.

v. Take a look at the clusters that your algorithm assigned to your test samples. Based on these clusters, which songs would you
recommend to this user?
Based off of my  test samples, the songs I would recommend are sad and obsene songs
